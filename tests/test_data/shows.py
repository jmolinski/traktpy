    "overview": "Eight couples whose relationships have reached breaking point are whisked off to a tropical Mexican resort, where they will find out whether their current squeezes are really right for them. Expert-led behaviour workshops, challenges, and sex therapy sessions aim to give each participant a deeper understanding of themselves, and each other.
